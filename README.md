This is where I upload the tasks from the SoftUni: Frontend course. 

The HTML files contain only the HTML code, whereas the CSS files contain the styling(separately). 
In some tasks, there are text files, holding the contents of the page, and/or png files containing the end result of the page(what the page is supposed to look like once created).
